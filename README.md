# WyRm
The devolved Snake game we all wish I hadn't made

## What is WyRm?
It's a really crappy game. It's even more crappily coded. I'm trying to fix both
of these. The first bit is probably here to stay, but the second bit can be
improved.
![Dude! You're a *wyrm*][wyrm1]
## Why should I play WyRm?
Honestly? You shouldn't.
![*Dude!* You get to eat *fractalssss*][wyrm2]
## Ben, I haven't read any of the things above this. How do I install?
1. Download this
2. Install pygame (`sudo apt-get install python-pygame` or `pip install pygame`
   should do the trick)
3. Give away your computer because you've ruined it
4. Never speak of this again
![**DUUUUDE!!!**  FRACTALS!!!!][wyrm3]
## Ben, this crashes and my terminal is all messed up
You need to make sure the terminal is big enough. Make sure it's at least 81x35
characters in dimension, because this is written really poorly and breaks for
the slightest reason.

## Ben, WTF are the controls?
ASDW dude. Oh, and hit M For menu.

## Ben, I really don't like your game.
Dude, I warned you.

## Ben, you're too hard on yourself. This is a great game!!
Thank you so much, Ben, it's so nice to finally get some good feedback, even if
it is from myself.

## I *Love* the music
Thanks, I spent 24 hours of my life programming frequencies and time durations
into Audacity. I got lazy and rounded off some of the decimals, that's why it
sounds out of tune.
